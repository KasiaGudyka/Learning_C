# Learning_C
---------------------------------
Examples of codes and programs written while studying languages C and C++ from various sources, like Heckerrank, a book "Learn C language the hard way", etc.

I attended a semester on programming in C at my university but started studying C++ independently in November 2020, completed the C++ course on SoloLearn (link: https://www.sololearn.com/certificates/course/en/20858943/1051/landscape/png) and currently attend a C++ online course provided by Nokia (link: https://nokiawroclaw.pl/careers/nokia-academy/)
